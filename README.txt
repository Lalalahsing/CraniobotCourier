The Craniobot Courier is a GUI for interfacing with a CNC machine running g2 (g2core or TinyG). It borrows many aspects from other Gcode senders, such as:

* Automatic Flow Control (using linemode protocol)
* Position Monitoring
* Machine Status and Error Reporting
* A Serial Command Terminal
* Shortcuts for Common Commands

The purpose of building a custom GUI in lieu of Chillipeppr or UGS is to create a single, integrated environment for controlling the Craniobot. In addition to the standard features, this software package allows the user to probe complex topographies and generate tool paths tailored to each surface. It will also simplify future development through the use of MATLAB's extensive libraries and documentation.
